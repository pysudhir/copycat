/**
 * Stores a state machine operation.

 * Each state machine operation is stored with a client-provided {@link #getSequence() sequence number}.
 * The sequence number is used by state machines to apply client operations in the order in which they
 * were submitted by the client (FIFO order). Additionally, each operation is written with the leader's
 * {@link #getTimestamp() timestamp} at the time the entry was logged. This gives state machines an
 * approximation of time with which to react to the application of operations to the state machine.
