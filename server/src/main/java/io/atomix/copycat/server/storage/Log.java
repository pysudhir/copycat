/**
 * Stores Raft log entries in a segmented log in memory or on disk.
 * <p>
 * The log is the primary vehicle for storing state changes and managing replication in Raft. The log is used to verify
 * consistency between members and manage cluster configurations, client sessions, state machine operations, and other
 * tasks.
 * <p>
 * State changes are written to the log as {@link Entry} objects. Each entry is associated with an {@code index} and
 * {@code term}. The {@code index} is a 1-based entry index from the start of the log. The {@code term} is used for
 * various consistency checks in the Raft algorithm. Raft guarantees that a {@link #commit(long) committed} entry at any
 * index {@code i} that has term {@code t} will also be present in the logs on all other servers in the cluster at the
 * same index {@code i} with term {@code t}. However, note that log compaction may break this contract. Considering log
 * compaction, it's more accurate to say that iff committed entry {@code i} is present in another server's log, that
 * entry has term {@code t} and the same value.
 * <p>
 * Entries are written to the log via the {@link #append(Entry)} method. When an entry is appended, it's written to the
 * next sequential index in the log after {@link #lastIndex()}. Entries can be created from a typed entry pool with the
 * {@link #create(Class)} method. <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   long index;
 *   try (CommandEntry entry = log.create(CommandEntry.class)) {
 *     entry.setTerm(2)
 *       .setSequence(5)
 *       .setCommand(new PutCommand());
 *     index = log.append(entry);
 *   }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * {@link Entry entries} are appended to {@link Segment}s in the log. Segments are individual file or memory based
 * groups of sequential entries. Each segment has a fixed capacity in terms of either number of entries or size in
 * bytes. Once the capacity of a segment has been reached, the log rolls over to a new segment for the next entry that's
 * appended.
 * <p>
 * Internally, each segment maintains an in-memory index of entries. The index stores the offset and position of each
 * entry within the segment's internal {@link io.atomix.catalyst.buffer.Buffer}. For entries that are appended to the
 * log sequentially, the index has an O(1) lookup time. For instances where entries in a segment have been skipped (due
 * to log compaction), the lookup time is O(log n) due to binary search. However, due to the nature of the Raft
 * consensus algorithm, readers should typically benefit from O(1) lookups.
 * <p>
 * In order to prevent exhausting disk space, the log manages a set of background threads that periodically rewrite and
 * combine segments to free disk space. This is known as log compaction. As entries are committed to the log and applied
 * to the Raft state machine as {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.Commit} objects, state machines {@link #release(long)}
 * entries that no longer apply to the state machine state. Internally, each log {@link Segment} maintains a compact
 * {@link io.atomix.catalyst.buffer.util.BitArray} to track the liveness of entries. When an entry is released, the entry's
 * offset is set in the bit array for the associated segment. The bit array represents the state of entries waiting to
 * be compacted from the log.
 * <p>
 * As entries are written to the log, segments reach their capacity and the log rolls over into new segments. Once a
 * segment is full and all of its entries have been {@link #commit(long) committed}, indicating they cannot be removed,
 * the segment becomes eligible for compaction. Log compaction processes come in two forms:
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.storage.compaction.Compaction#MINOR} and
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.storage.compaction.Compaction#MAJOR}, which can be configured in the {@link Storage}
 * configuration. Minor and major compaction serve to remove normal entries and tombstones from the log respectively.
 * <p>
 * Minor compaction is the more frequent and lightweight process. Periodically, according to the configured
 * {@link Storage#minorCompactionInterval()}, a background thread will evaluate the log for minor compaction. The minor
 * compaction process iterates through segments and selects compactable segments based on the ratio of entries that have
 * been {@link #release(long) released}. Minor compaction is generational. The
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.storage.compaction.MinorCompactionManager} is more likely to select segments that haven't
 * yet been compacted than ones that have. Once a set of segments have been compacted, for each segment a
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.storage.compaction.MinorCompactionTask} rewrites the segment without released entries.
 * This rewriting results in a segment with missing entries, and Copycat's Raft implementation accounts for that. For
 * instance, a segment with entries {@code {1, 2, 3}} can become {@code {1, 3}} after being released, and any attempt to
 * {@link #get(long) read} entry {@code 2} will result in a {@code null} entry.
 * <p>
 * However, note that minor compaction only applies to non-tombstone entries. Tombstones are entries that represent the
 * removal of state from the system, and that requires a more careful and costly compaction process to ensure consistency
 * in the event of a failure. Consider a state machine with the following two commands in the log:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code put 1}</li>
 * <li>{@code remove 1}</li>
 * </ul>
 * If the first command is written to segment {@code 1}, and the second command is written to segment {@code 2},
 * compacting segment {@code 2} (minor compaction may compact segments in any order) without removing the first command
 * from segment {@code 1} would effectively result in the undoing of the {@code remove 1} command. If the {@code remove 1}
 * command is removed from the log before {@code put 1}, a restart and replay of the log will result in the application of
 * {@code put 1} to the state machine, but not {@code remove 1}, thus resulting in an inconsistent state machine state.
 * <p>
 * As entries are removed from the log during minor and major compaction, log segment files begin to shrink. Copycat
 * does not want to have a thousand file pointers open, so some mechanism is required to combine segments as disk space
 * is freed. To that end, as the major compaction process iterates through the set of committed segments and rewrites
 * live entries, it combines multiple segments up to the configured segment capacity. When a segment becomes full during
 * major compaction, the compaction process rolls over to a new segment and continues compaction. This results in a
 * significantly smaller number of files.
