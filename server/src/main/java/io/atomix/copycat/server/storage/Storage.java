/**
 * Immutable log configuration and {@link Log} factory.
 * <p>
 * This class provides a factory for {@link Log} objects. {@code Storage} objects are immutable and
 * can be created only via the {@link Storage.Builder}. To create a new
 * {@code Storage.Builder}, use the static {@link #builder()} factory method:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *     Storage storage = Storage.builder()
 *       .withDirectory(new File("logs"))
 *       .withStorageLevel(StorageLevel.DISK)
 *       .build();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Users can also configure a number of options related to how {@link Log logs} are constructed and managed.
 * Most notable of the configuration options is the number of {@link #compactionThreads()}, which specifies the
 * number of background threads to use to compact log {@link Segment segments}. The parallelism of the log
 * compaction algorithm will be limited by the number of {@link #compactionThreads()}.
