/**
 * Represents the committed state and metadata of a Raft state machine operation.
 * <p>
 * Commits are representative of a log {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.storage.entry.Entry} that has been replicated
 * and committed via the Raft consensus algorithm.
 * When {@link Command commands} and {@link Query queries} are applied to the Raft {@link StateMachine}, they're
 * wrapped in a commit object. The commit object provides useful metadata regarding the location of the commit
 * in the Raft replicated log, the {@link #time()} at which the commit was logged, and the {@link Session} that
 * submitted the operation to the cluster.
 * <p>
 * All metadata exposed by this interface is backed by disk. The {@link #operation() operation} and its metadata is
 * guaranteed to be consistent for a given {@link #index() index} across all servers in the cluster.
 * <p>
 * When state machines are done using a commit object, users should release the commit by calling {@link #close()}.
 * This notifies Copycat that it's safe to remove the commit from the log as it no longer contributes to the state
 * machine's state. Copycat guarantees that a commit will be retained in the log and replicated as long as it is
 * held open by the state machine. Failing to call either method is a bug and will result in disk eventually filling
 * up, and Copycat will log a warning message in such cases.
