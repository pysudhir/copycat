/**
 * Removes tombstones from the log and combines {@link Segment}s to reclaim disk space.
 * <p>
 * Major compaction is a more heavyweight compaction task which is responsible both for removing <em>tombstone</em>
 * {@link Entry entries} from the log and combining groups of neighboring log {@link Segment}s together.
 * <p>
 * <b>Combining segments</b>
 * <p>
 * As entries are written to the log and the log rolls over to new segments, entries are compacted out of individual
 * segments by {@link MinorCompactionTask}s. However, the minor compaction process only rewrites individual segments
 * and doesn't combine them. This will result in an ever growing number of open file pointers. During major compaction,
 * the major compaction task rewrites groups of segments provided by the {@link MajorCompactionManager}. For each group
 * of segments, a single compact segment will be created with the same {@code version} and starting {@code index} as
 * the first segment in the group. All entries from all segments in the group that haven't been
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.storage.Log#release(long) released} will then be written to the new compact segment.
 * Once the rewrite is complete, the compact segment will be locked and the set of old segments deleted.
 * <p>
 * <b>Removing tombstones</b>
 * <p>
 * Tombstones are {@link Entry entries} in the log which amount to state changes that <em>remove</em> state. That is,
 * tombstones are an indicator that some set of prior entries no longer contribute to the state of the system. Thus,
 * it is critical that tombstones remain in the log as long as any prior related entries do. If a tombstone is removed
 * from the log before its prior related entries, rebuilding state from the log will result in inconsistencies.
 * <p>
 * A significant objective of the major compaction task is to remove tombstones from the log in a manor that ensures
 * failures before, during, or after the compaction task will not result in inconsistencies when state is rebuilt from
 * the log. In order to ensure tombstones are removed only <em>after</em> any prior related entries, the major compaction
 * task simply compacts segments in sequential order from the {@link Segment#firstIndex()} of the first segment to the
 * {@link Segment#lastIndex()} of the last segment. This ensures that if a failure occurs during the compaction process,
 * only entries earlier in the log will have been removed, and potential tombstones which erase the state of those entries
 * will remain.
 * <p>
 * Nevertheless, there are some significant potential race conditions that must be considered in the implementation of
 * major compaction. The major compaction task assumes that state machines will always release <em>related</em> entries
 * in monotonically increasing order. That is, if a state machines receives a {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.Commit}
 * {@code remove 1} that deletes the state of a prior {@code Commit} {@code set 1}, the state machine will call
 * {@link Commit#close()} on the {@code set 1} commit before releasing the {@code remove 1} commit. But even if applications
 * release entries from the log in monotonic order, and the major compaction task compacts segments in sequential order,
 * inconsistencies can still arise. Consider the following history:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code set 1} is at index {@code 1} in segment {@code 1}</li>
 *   <li>{@code remove 1} is at index {@code 12345} in segment {@code 8}</li>
 *   <li>The major compaction task rewrites segment {@code 1}</li>
 *   <li>The application releases {@code set 1} at index {@code 1} in the <em>rewritten</em> version of segment {@code 1}</li>
 *   <li>The application releases {@code remove 1} at index {@code 12345} in segment {@code 8}, which the compaction task
 *   has yet to compact</li>
 *   <li>The compaction task compacts segments {@code 2} through {@code 8}, removing tombstone entry {@code 12345} during
 *   the process</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In the scenario above, the resulting log contains {@code set 1} but not {@code remove 1}. If we replayed those entries
 * as {@link Commit}s to the log, it would result in an inconsistent state. Worse yet, not only is this server's state
 * incorrect, but it will be inconsistent with other servers which are likely to have correctly removed both entry
 * {@code 1} and entry {@code 12345} during major compaction.
 * <p>
 * In order to prevent such a scenario from occurring, the major compaction task takes an immutable snapshot of the
 * state of offsets underlying all the segments to be compacted prior to rewriting any entries. This ensures that any
 * entries released after the start of rewriting segments will not be considered for compaction during the execution
 * of this task.
