/**
 * Base interface for operations that modify system state.
 * <p>
 * Commands are submitted by clients to a Raft server and used to modify Raft cluster-wide state. When a command
 * is submitted to the cluster, if the command is received by a follower, the Raft protocol dictates that it must be
 * forwarded to the cluster leader. Once the leader receives a command, it logs and replicates the command to a majority
 * of the cluster before applying it to its state machine and responding with the result.
 * <h2>Consistency levels</h2>
 * Commands are allow both to modify system state and to trigger events
 * published to client {@link Session sessions}. Whereas {@link Query} consistency
 * levels dictate when and how queries can be executed on follower nodes, command
 * {@link Command.ConsistencyLevel consistency levels} largely relate to how events triggered
 * by commands are handled. When a command is applied to a server state machine, the consistency level of the command
 * being executed dictates the requirements for handling the event. For instance, in a fictitious lock state machine,
 * one command might be the {@code UnlockCommand}. The unlock command would set the state machine state to {@code unlocked}
 * and perhaps send a message to any lock waiters notifying them that the lock is available. In this case,
 * {@link Command.ConsistencyLevel#LINEARIZABLE linearizable} consistency can be used to ensure
 * that lock holders are notified before the {@code unlock} operation completes.
 * <h2>Compaction modes</h2>
 * <em>Determinism is the number one rule of state machines!</em>
 * <p>
 * When commands are submitted to the Raft cluster, they're written to a commit log on disk or in memory (based on the
 * storage configuration) and replicated to a majority of the cluster. As disk usage grows over time, servers compact
 * their logs to remove commands that no longer contribute to the state machine's state. In order to ensure state machines
 * remain deterministic, commands must provide {@link CompactionMode compaction modes}
 * to aid servers in deciding when it's safe to remove a command from the log. The compaction mode allows state machines
 * to safely handle the complexities of removing state from state machines while ensuring state machines remain
 * deterministic, particularly in the event of a failure and replay of the commit log. See the
 * {@link CompactionMode} documentation for more info.
 * <h3>Serialization</h3>
 * Commands must be serializable both by the client and by all servers in the cluster. By default, all operations use
 * Java serialization. However, default serialization in slow because it requires the full class name and does not allocate
 * memory efficiently. For this reason, it's recommended that commands implement {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.CatalystSerializable}
 * or register a custom {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.TypeSerializer} for better performance. Serializable types
 * can be registered on the associated client/server {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.Serializer} instance.

  /**
   * Constants for specifying command compaction modes.
   * <p>
   * Compaction modes dictate how each command is removed from a Copycat server's internal logs. As commands
   * are submitted to the cluster, written to disk, and replicated, the replicated log can grow unbounded.
   * Command compaction modes allow servers to determine when it's safe to remove a command from the log.
   * Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the state machine and the command applied to it to indicate when
   * the command may be removed from the log. Typically, commands should not be removed from the log until
   * they either no longer contribute to the state machine's state or some other mechanism ensures that the
   * command's state will not be loss, such as is the case with snapshotting.
   * <p>
   * Commands to a Copycat state machine typically come in one of two flavors; commands are either compacted from
   * the log via snapshotting or log cleaning. Log cleaning is the process of removing commands from the log when
   * they no longer contribute to the state machine's state. Commands compacted via log cleaning are represented
   * by the {@link #QUORUM}, {@link #FULL}, {@link #SEQUENTIAL}, and {@link #TOMBSTONE} compaction modes. These types
   * of commands are removed from the log in a manor consistent with the configured compaction mode.
   * <p>
   * Alternatively, the simpler mode of compaction is snapshotting. Snapshotted commands are indicated by the
   * {@link #SNAPSHOT} compaction mode. When a server takes a snapshot of a state machine, all commands applied
   * to the state machine up to the logical time at which the snapshot was taken may be removed from the log.
   * <p>
   * It's important to note that command compaction modes only take effect once a command applied to a state
   * machine has been released for compaction. State machines effectively manage commands applied to a state machine
   * like memory. It's always the responsibility of a state machine to indicate when a command can be safely
   * compacted according to its compaction mode by releasing the command back to the server's storage layer for
   * compaction. See the state machine documentation for more info.
