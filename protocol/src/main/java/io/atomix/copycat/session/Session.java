/**
 * Represents a client's connection to the Copycat cluster.
 * <p>
 * Each client that connects to a Raft cluster must open a {@link Session} in order to submit operations to the cluster.
 * When a client first connects to a server, it must register a new session. Once the session has been registered,
 * it can be used to submit {@link io.atomix.copycat.Command commands} and {@link io.atomix.copycat.Query queries}
 * to the cluster.
 * <p>
 * Sessions represent a connection between a single client and all servers in a Raft cluster. Session information
 * is replicated via the Raft consensus algorithm, and clients can safely switch connections between servers without
 * losing their session. All consistency guarantees are provided within the context of a session. Once a session is
 * expired or closed, linearizability, sequential consistency, and other guarantees for events and operations are
 * effectively lost.
 * <p>
 * Throughout the lifetime of a session it can transition between a number of different
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.session.Session.State states}. Session states are indicative of the client's ability to
 * maintain its connections to the cluster and the cluster's ability to provide certain semantics within the context
 * of the session. The current state of a session can be read via the {@link #state()} method, and users can react to
 * changes in the session state by registering a state change listener via {@link #onStateChange(Consumer)}.
 * <p>
 * The ideal state of a session is the {@link Session.State#OPEN OPEN} state which indicates that the client has
 * registered a session and has successfully submitted a keep-alive request within the last session timeout. In the
 * event that a client cannot communicate with any server in the cluster or the cluster has not received a keep-alive
 * from a client within a session timeout, the session's state will be changed to {@link Session.State#UNSTABLE UNSTABLE},
 * indicating that the session may be expired. While in the {@code UNSTABLE} state, Copycat cannot guarantee linearizable
 * semantics for operations. From the {@code UNSTABLE} state, the session will either transition back to the
 * {@code OPEN} state or into the {@link Session.State#EXPIRED EXPIRED} state, indicating that linearizability guarantees
 * have been lost. Finally, sessions that are explicitly unregistered by a client will be transitioned to the
 * {@link Session.State#CLOSED CLOSED} state.
