/**
 * Connection strategies define how clients should handle initializing connections to the cluster.
 * <p>
 * Connection strategies are used by the {@link CopycatClient} at startup to indicate how to handle
 * failures when connecting to the cluster. When a client is first started, the client will attempt to
 * any server listed in the {@link io.atomix.catalyst.transport.Address address} list provided to the
 * client at startup. If the client fails to register a new session with any server, the connection
 * strategy will dictate how to handle the failure.
 * <p>
 * Connection strategies are used in the same manner when attempting to recover a lost session. In
 * the event that a client's connection to the cluster is lost and the client must open a new session,
 * if recovering the client's session fails then the connection strategy will again dictate how to
 * handle the failure.
